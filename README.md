# Impact of Project
- Create an overall clean and functional UI/UX for users to navigate a restaurant website.
- Take client requirements generated by ChatGPT and implement as many as we can using the time given.
- Work as a team in a Scrum like developemnt cycle to work on seperate pieces of the website and then implement them all together.

# Project Architecture. 
### Web App
- We will be using what we learned in WebApps. (pug and js) to build the Web App
- **Tools/Software we will use: Pug, JS, host on Render**

### Database
- needed for accounts (User, Employee, Supervisor)
- menu items
- **Tools/Software we will use: MongoDB**

```
Most things that shouldnt be tracked by git are already included in the ```.gitignore``` and you shouldn't need to worry about them. 

# Getting started.
1. Open a terminal to where you would like to save the project
2. input the following commands
```
### Cloning The repo
git clone https://github.com/2025SpringSoftwareDev/2025SpringSoftDevProject.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd 2025SpringSoftDevProject
```
3. install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
4. troubleshoot any issues that arise with instalation.
5. use command ```npm install``` to install all dependences from package.json 
6. use command ```npm start``` to host the webapp locally
7. use a browser access the web app at ```http://localhost:3000/```
8. use ```ctrl + c``` to kill the process in the termanal

### Lingering terminal
In the event you get an error that looks like this, its likely that the app is already started and running.
```
node:events:502
      throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
      ^

Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
    at Server.setupListenHandle [as _listen2] (node:net:1937:16)
    at listenInCluster (node:net:1994:12)
    at Server.listen (node:net:2099:7)
    at Function.listen (C:\Users\s553982\Documents\SoftwareEngPrinc\2025Spring\Group Projects\2025SpringSoftDevProject\node_modules\express\lib\application.js:635:24)
    at Object.<anonymous> (C:\Users\s553982\Documents\SoftwareEngPrinc\2025Spring\Group Projects\2025SpringSoftDevProject\app.js:57:5)
    at Module._compile (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1562:14)
    at Object..js (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1699:10)
    at Module.load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1313:32)
    at Function._load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1123:12)
    at TracingChannel.traceSync (node:diagnostics_channel:322:14)
Emitted 'error' event on Server instance at:
    at emitErrorNT (node:net:1973:8)
    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:90:21) {
  code: 'EADDRINUSE',
  errno: -4091,
  syscall: 'listen',
  address: '::',
  port: 3000
}
```
 To fix this you will need to end the process running on that port or use a differnt port. If you want to end the process and dont know where its running, use thse these commands.
```
Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000).OwningProcess
Stop-Process -Id 11228 -Force 
```
replace the number with the app id. 

### Branches
- We can use branches to develop features then merge the branch to main once the feature is completed. 
- This allows us to reduce merge conflicts and avoid convoluting the main branch's comment history.
#### Creating a new branch.
  ```
  git checkout -b <branch-name>
  ```
#### Changing a branch.
  ```
  git checkout <branch-name>
  ```
#### Creating a pull request.
1. Ensure you pushed and tested all changes
2. Go to the GitHub repo page and click "Pull request"
3. Select your branch as the source and the main branch as the destination
4. Fill out the info and submit the pull request.
5. Since we don't have any live features or customers you can just accept the pull request yourself without peer review. If you break anything o well there is no collateral to be had.
