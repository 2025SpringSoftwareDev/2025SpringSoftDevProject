# 2025SpringSoftDevProject
Project Members: Carter Plenge,

## We will be making a web page and app for a restaurant. 

### Requirements
- Users must be able to access/see the menu from the website.
- Users should be able to make reservations from the website.
- Employees should be able to see reservations and plan accordingly.
- Users shouldn't be able to access information meant for employees. 

### Sub-objectives (what's the professional terminology for this again?)
- Users should be allowed to make accounts to make future reservations easier. 
- The website should be responsive to the maximum capacity of restaurants to prevent overbooking reservations. 
- Users should be able to reserve their preference for the table. (booth/table/bar/etc)
- The website should have an interactive display of all reservations and locations to inform employees of available tables and reservations easily

## Project Aciterectuer. 
### Webpage
- can be split into front-end and back-end if needed but given the scale of the  project we can keep them bundled in the same repo.
- **Tools/Software we will use: Render**

### Database
- needed for user accounts
- **Tools/Software we will use: MongoDB**

  Note: None of this has not been confirmed and reviewed by the group as a whole.
